## Preface
 This book is written as a quick reference or a quick way to get familiar with RabbitMQ's terminology, inner-workings and scalability. It is not meant to give you insights in every aspect and configuration of RabbitMQ, but the big picture so you can have some initial knowledge when you search and learn more about RabbitMQ.

This book is written by gathering information from many resources like: RabbitMQ official documentation, Pluralsight video courses, ClounAMQP, RabbitMQ Summit, Wikipedia etc.
